# T1584.005: Botnet
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Resource Development

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/005)**
<blockquote>Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnetÂ that can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.(Citation: Norton Botnet) Instead of purchasing/renting a botnet from a booter/stresser service(Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire), adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising numerous third-party systems. Adversaries may also conduct a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 servers.(Citation: Dell Dridex Oct 2015) With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).</blockquote>
