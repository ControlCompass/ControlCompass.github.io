# T1078.003: Local Accounts
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Defense Evasion, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Initial Access

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/003)**
<blockquote>Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a local account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service.

Local Accounts may also be abused to elevate privileges and harvest credentials through [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). Password reuse may allow the abuse of local accounts across a set of machines on a network for the purposes of Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement. </blockquote>
