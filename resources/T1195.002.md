# T1195.002: Compromise Software Supply Chain
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Initial Access

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/002)**
<blockquote>Adversaries may manipulate application software prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Supply chain compromise of software can take place in a number of ways, including manipulation of the application source code, manipulation of the update/distribution mechanism for that software, or replacing compiled releases with a modified version.

Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.(Citation: Avast CCleaner3 2018) (Citation: Command Five SK 2011)  </blockquote>
