# T1087.002: Domain Account
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Discovery

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/002)**
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of domain accounts. This information can help adversaries determine which domain accounts exist to aid in follow-on behavior.

Commands such as <code>net user /domain</code> and <code>net group /domain</code> of the [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) utility, <code>dscacheutil -q group</code>on macOS, and <code>ldapsearch</code> on Linux can list domain users and groups.</blockquote>
