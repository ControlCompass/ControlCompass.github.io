# T1056.003: Web Portal Capture
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Collection, Credential Access

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)**
<blockquote>Adversaries may install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. For example, a compromised login page may log provided user credentials before logging the user in to the service.

This variation on input capture may be conducted post-compromise using legitimate administrative access as a backup measure to maintain network access through [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133) and [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) or as part of the initial compromise by exploitation of the externally facing web service.(Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging)</blockquote>
