# T1542: Pre-OS Boot
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Defense Evasion, Persistence

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542)**
<blockquote>Adversaries may abuse Pre-OS Boot mechanisms as a way to establish persistence on a system. During the booting process of a computer, firmware and various startup services are loaded before the operating system. These programs control flow of execution before the operating system takes control.(Citation: Wikipedia Booting)

Adversaries may overwrite data in boot drivers or firmware such as BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) to persist on systems at a layer below the operating system. This can be particularly difficult to detect as malware at this level will not be detected by host software-based defenses.</blockquote>
