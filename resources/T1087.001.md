# T1087.001: Local Account
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Discovery

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/001)**
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of local system accounts. This information can help adversaries determine which local accounts exist on a system to aid in follow-on behavior.

Commands such as <code>net user</code> and <code>net localgroup</code> of the [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) utility and <code>id</code> and <code>groups</code>on macOS and Linux can list local users and groups. On Linux, local users can also be enumerated through the use of the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file. On macOS the <code>dscl . list /Users</code> command can be used to enumerate local accounts.</blockquote>
