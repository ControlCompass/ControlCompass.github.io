**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Exfiltration

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1052/001)**
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over a USB connected physical device. In certain circumstances, such as an air-gapped network compromise, exfiltration could occur via a USB device introduced by a user. The USB device could be used as the final exfiltration point or to hop between otherwise disconnected systems.</blockquote>
