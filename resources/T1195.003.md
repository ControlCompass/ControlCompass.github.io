# T1195.003: Compromise Hardware Supply Chain
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Initial Access

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/003)**
<blockquote>Adversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system. Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals.</blockquote>
