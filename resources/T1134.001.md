# T1134.001: Token Impersonation/Theft
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)**
<blockquote>Adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. An adversary can create a new access token that duplicates an existing token using <code>DuplicateToken(Ex)</code>. The token can then be used with <code>ImpersonateLoggedOnUser</code> to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with <code>SetThreadToken</code> to assign the impersonated token to a thread.

An adversary may do this when they have a specific, existing process they want to assign the new token to. For example, this may be useful for when the target user has a non-network logon session on the system.</blockquote>
