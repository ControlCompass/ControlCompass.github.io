# T1564.001: Hidden Files and Directories
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Defense Evasion

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/001)**
<blockquote>Adversaries may set files and directories to be hidden to evade detection mechanisms. To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a â€˜hiddenâ€™ file. These files donâ€™t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls â€“a</code> for Linux and macOS).

On Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a â€œ.â€ as the first character in the file or folder name  (Citation: Sofacy Komplex Trojan) (Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware). Files and folders that start with a period, â€˜.â€™, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like â€œlsâ€. Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.

Files on macOS can also be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app (Citation: WireLurker). On Windows, users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesnâ€™t clutter up the userâ€™s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder thatâ€™s hidden and contains the userâ€™s known hosts and keys.

Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.</blockquote>
