# T1555.002: Securityd Memory
**MITRE ATT&CK Tactic(s):** Credential Access

**[MITRE ATT&CK Description](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/002)**
<blockquote>An adversary may obtain root access (allowing them to read securitydâ€™s memory), then they can scan through memory to find the correct sequence of keys in relatively few tries to decrypt the userâ€™s logon keychain. This provides the adversary with all the plaintext passwords for users, WiFi, mail, browsers, certificates, secure notes, etc.(Citation: OS X Keychain) (Citation: OSX Keydnap malware)

In OS X prior to El Capitan, users with root access can read plaintext keychain passwords of logged-in users because Appleâ€™s keychain implementation allows these credentials to be cached so that users are not repeatedly prompted for passwords. (Citation: OS X Keychain) (Citation: External to DA, the OS X Way) Appleâ€™s securityd utility takes the userâ€™s logon password, encrypts it with PBKDF2, and stores this master key in memory. Apple also uses a set of keys and algorithms to encrypt the userâ€™s password, but once the master key is found, an attacker need only iterate over the other values to unlock the final password.(Citation: OS X Keychain)</blockquote>
